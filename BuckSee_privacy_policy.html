            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Your privacy is incredibly important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle your information within the BuckSee app. My philosophy is simple: I believe in strong privacy protection, and I've built BuckSee with that principle in mind.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Data Collection and Use</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>No Data Collection by BuckSee:</strong> BuckSee is designed to be a <strong>100% offline application</strong>. I do not collect, process, transmit, store, or otherwise interact with any of your personal data or usage data. Your data stays on your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Servers:</strong> I do not operate any backend servers for BuckSee. There is no server to send your data to, because there is no data leaving your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No User Accounts:</strong> BuckSee does not require or support user accounts. This means I have no personal information about you to store.
                </li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">App Permissions and Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                BuckSee requires access to your phone's local storage. This permission is strictly for the purpose of enabling core app functionalities related to your data management.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Database Storage:</strong> The app stores all information regarding your working times and predicted earnings in a local SQL database directly on your device. This data is essential for the app's functionality and for providing you with a complete overview of your activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Control and Export/Import:</strong> The data stored in this local database can be easily exported by you, for example, to an Excel file for further processing or backup outside the app. This also allows you to import your data onto another device if you choose to do so, giving you full control over your information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strictly Local Data:</strong> It is crucial to understand that all data saved within this local SQL database remains <strong>entirely on your device</strong>. I, as the developer, never send, receive, or access these database entries or any of your local data. Your data never leaves your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> This local data is cleared when the app's memory is cleared or when you uninstall the BuckSee app from your device.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Third-Party Services (Google Ads)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The BuckSee app itself does not collect, process, or send any user data to Google or any other third party. The only interaction with external services is through the integration of <strong>Google Ads</strong>, which operates independently within the app. This means that while ads are displayed, BuckSee does not facilitate or participate in the transmission of your data to Google.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Google's Role:</strong> Google, as a third-party advertisement provider, may collect and process certain data for the purpose of serving relevant ads. This data processing is performed by Google and is governed solely by Google's own Privacy Policy. Crucially, BuckSee does not send any user data to Google, nor do I receive, access, store, or manage any data collected by Google Ads. I do not process any user data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can review Google's Privacy Policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold">here</a>.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Data Security</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Since BuckSee does not collect or transmit any user data, the security of your data relies solely on the security of your device. I implement no server-side security measures because no data leaves your device.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
